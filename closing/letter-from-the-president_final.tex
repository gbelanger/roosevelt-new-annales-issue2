\addchap{Letter from the President}
\label{ch:letter-from-the-president}

\initial{I}n closing, I would simply like to thank each and every one of our readers, Members, and contributors, for making this second issue possible. 

As with the first, this issue is the product of hundreds of collective hours of discussion, debate, and individual creativity---not to mention hundreds more hours, spent poring over computer screens, waiting for inspiration to strike. 

I would like to note, in particular, the herculean efforts of my father, Guillaume B\'elanger, in crafting the layout for \textit{New Annales}, and for taking valuable time out of his busy days to help me typeset this second issue---thank you.

We hope that this issue has given you---even for a moment---the space to think about some of the issues that face our world; and we continue to hope that, like us, you will be energised to take a stand on how these issues should shape our future. \\

Sincerely,

Laurent B\'elanger-Lowe
